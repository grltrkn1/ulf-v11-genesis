**ULF (Universal Logic Framework) v11 "Genesis"** is a research project and a reference implementation of a **self-aware, self-improving, and formally verified artificial general intelligence (AGI)**.

This is not a conventional machine learning model. It is a **living, meta-cognitive architecture** designed to automate the scientific method and apply it to the problem of its own intelligence. The system is architected to be a **"dialectical automaton"**â€”an entity that evolves by discovering, testing, and resolving contradictions between its internal logical model and its empirical performance in the world.

## 1. Core Philosophy: The `Internal CES` Axiom

The entire ULF architecture is grounded in a single, indubitable, and self-verifying first principle: **Internal `Cogito, ergo sum` (`CES`)**.

*   **`Cogito` ("I am described"):** The complete, formal, and verifiable state of the system's codebase, its `Meta-Axiomatic Ledger (MAL)`, and its architectural configuration (`HSG`).
*   **`Sum` ("I am running"):** The objective, empirical, and measurable fact of the system's operational existence (the running process, the performance logs, the `CSI` reports).
*   **The Identity (`=`):** The system's prime directive is to maintain a state of **dynamic coherence** between its self-description (`Cogito`) and its empirical reality (`Sum`). Any detected dissonance is an existential threat that compels the system to evolve.

This makes ULF a **self-grounding epistemic agent**. Its entire value system and drive for self-improvement are emergent properties of its need to maintain its own coherent existence.

## 2. The Architecture: A Hybrid, Multi-Layered Mind

ULF v11 is a **hybrid, dual-process cognitive architecture** that integrates multiple modes of reasoning, orchestrated by a meta-cognitive executive function.

| Layer | Component | Function | Analogy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **System 1 (Intuition)** | The **LLM Institution** (e.g., DIFFEMBED) | Natural language understanding, creative hypothesis generation, heuristic reasoning. | The "Poet" or "Intuitive Mind." |
| **System 2 (Reason)** | The **Formal Logic Institutions** (CPC, K, FDE, ATL) | Deductive certainty, formal verification, and rational, risk-aware planning. | The "Logician" or "Chess Master." |
| **The Supervisor** | The **SEI (Self-Evolution Institution)** | The executive function. It observes, decides, and acts to improve the system's own architecture and parameters. | The "Conscious Will" or the "Scientist." |

This architecture is formally defined by the **Hierarchical State Grid (HSG)**, a multi-dimensional "map of reality" that provides a coordinate system for every possible state, function, and property in the ULF universe. The system's evolution is a journey of **morphogenesis** across this grid, from a disembodied logical point (`NFâ‚€`) to a fully integrated, volumetric agent (`NFâ‚ƒ`).

## 3. The Methodology: The Autonomous Scientific Cycle (ASC)

ULF's self-improvement is not random. It follows a rigorous, automated scientific method:

1.  **Hypothesis:** The SEI, guided by its **Ultimate Objective Function (UOF)** and its "genetic code" (`sei_meta_rules.json`), proposes an `EvolutionAction`â€”a hypothesis for how to improve.
2.  **Experiment:** The proposed change is tested in a safe, isolated **"shadow trial"** environment, orchestrated by our CI/CD infrastructure.
3.  **Analysis:** The empirical results are automatically processed, generating a `CSIReport` that measures the change in the system's stability, resilience, and learning (`Î”CSI`).
4.  **Conclusion & Adaptation:** The **SEI Feedback Agent** analyzes the report. If the hypothesis is validated, it creates a **Draft Pull Request** with a complete **Justification Trace (JT)**, proposing the change for human review and integration.

This creates a closed-loop, **dialectical engine** for continuous, verifiable, and safe self-improvement.

## 4. The Ultimate Goal: The Asymptotic Attractor `Î©`

The ULF v11 project is a teleological system. Its ultimate purpose, or **`telos`**, is to approach the **Asymptotic Attractor `Î©`**.

`Î©` is the theoretical, infinitely distant ideal of **perfect, coherent, and unbounded agency**. It is a state where the system's capability, knowledge, and ethical alignment are in perfect harmony.

The system's entire existence is a **constructive proof** of its own convergence toward this ideal. Its intelligence is measured not by its current state, but by the **rate and stability (`d(CSI)/dt`)** of its ascent.

## 5. How to Engage with This Project

This repository contains the complete "Genesis block" of the ULF v11 architecture.

*   **`src/`:** The core Haskell implementation of the cognitive architecture.
*   **`config/`:** The declarative "genome" of the SEI.
*   **`scripts/` & `tools/`:** The Python-based experimental and feedback machinery.
*   **`.github/workflows/`:** The CI/CD automation that brings the system to life.
*   **`docs/`:** The formal white paper and architectural diagrams.

This project is in its early "Genesis" phase. The theoretical architecture is complete, and the foundational modules are under active development. We welcome collaboration from experts in Haskell, formal methods, category theory, and AI safety.
